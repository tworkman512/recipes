# Recipes
Recipes are step by step instructions to help you connect your TJBot to [Watson cognitive services](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/services-catalog.html).
The recipes are designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi. You can either run one of the available recipes or create your own recipe that brings sweet ideas to life using any combination of [Watson API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/services-catalog.html)!

### [Speech to Text](speech_to_text)
> Use your voice to control a LED with Watson [[instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-Your-Voice-to-Control-a-Light-With-Watson/)] [[github](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot/tree/master/recipes/speech_to_text)]

This module provides a Node.js code to control a [NeoPixel RGB led](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1938) using voice commands. It uses [Watson Speech to Text API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html).

###[Sentiment Analysis](sentiment_analysis)
> Make your bot respond to emotions using Watson [[instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Your-Robot-Respond-to-Emotions-Using-Watson/)] [[github](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot/tree/master/recipes/sentiment_analysis)]

This module provides Node.js code to control the color of a [NeoPixel RGB led](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1938) based on public perception of a given keyword (e.g. "heart" or "iPhone"). The module connects to Twitter to analyze the public sentiment about the given keyword in real time, and updates the color of the LED to reflect the sentiment. It uses [Watson Tone Analyzer](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html) and Twitter API.



###[Conversation](conversation)
> Build a talking robot with Watson [[instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Talking-Robot-With-Watson-and-Raspberry-Pi/)] [[github](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot/tree/master/recipes/conversation)]

This module provides Node.js code to get your Raspberry Pi to talk. It uses [Watson Speech to Text](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html) to parse audio from the microphone, uses [Watson Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation.html) to generate a response, and uses [Watson Text to Speech](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/text-to-speech.html) to "read" out this response!



## Featured Recipes

- SwiftyTJ that enables TJBotâ€™s LED to be controlled from a Swift program [[github](https://github.com/jweisz/swifty-tj)]
- Build a TJBot that cares [[instructions](https://medium.com/ibm-watson-developer-cloud/build-a-chatbot-that-cares-part-1-d1c273e17a63#.6sg1yfh4w)] [[github](https://github.com/boxcarton/tjbot-raspberrypi-nodejs)]
- Project Intu, not a recipe but a middleware that can be installed on TJBot and be used to architect more complex interactions for your robot [[developercloud](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/project-intu.html)] [[github](https://github.com/watson-intu/self-sdk#raspberry-pi)]

## Contributing Your Own Recipes
TJ Bot is open source and we'd love to see what you can make with him. If you have created your own recipe, we would love to include it on the list above! Send us a link to a your github repo (and a short demo video) to tjbot@us.ibm.com (Vimeo & YouTube preferred). We will review it include it on our list where appropriate. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

We cannot wait to see what you build with TJBot!
